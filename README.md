# Rabbit trap JS platformer game - mod

Forked from [frankarendpoth](https://github.com/frankarendpoth/frankarendpoth.github.io) to **experiment with making JavaScript platformers.**

His original game can be checked [here](http://frankpoth.info/content/pop-vlog/javascript/2018/006-rabbit-trap/rabbit-trap.html?07).
The tutorial he made for freeCodeCamp.org is available on YouTube: [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OKdSHRlfA).

Thanks Frank!

> This github repository is mainly used to store the projects I write for my YouTube Channel, Poth on Programming Video Log. These projects are largely focused on game design. You can also find the code for my website, which is just a way to access the working examples from my channel in a browser.

# Run game locally

`yarn start` [server.js](/server.js) (using express) and open http://localhost:5000/rabbit-trap.html.
